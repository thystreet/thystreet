# Webhook

## What is a Webhook?

A webhook (also called a web callback or push API) is a way for an app to provide other applications with real-time information. A webhook delivers data to other applications as it happens, meaning you get data immediately. Unlike typical APIs where you would need to poll for data very frequently to get it real-time.

#### Example

If you have your webhook set up properly, you will receive a notification every time a user completes the payment process.
