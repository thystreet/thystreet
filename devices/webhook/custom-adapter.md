# Custom Adapter

An adapter is a piece of software that converts HTTP protocol to your own. There are various ways to achieve that.&#x20;

One such example of a custom adapter that converts HTTP to MQTT protocol, written in node js, is available at [https://github.com/thystreet/http-mqtt-adapter](https://github.com/thystreet/http-mqtt-adapter). This is just for explanatory purposes and not recommended to be used in production, and pull requests are welcomed.
